#### Advanced Data Science - NLP Exam Project

*Emanuele Lena*

## Introduction

The purpose of this project is to analyze the 16 psychological types of the Myers-Briggs Type Indicator (MBTI) using Natural Language Processing (NLP) and data science techniques. 

In this project we will: 

- explore the description of the 16 MBTI types, using summarization techniques to extract brief descriptions of each type;
- use clustering and PCA techniques to identify similarities between the types and attempt to group them; 
- use topic labelling to identify the main topics of each type, to try to understand what are the types characteristics emerging from the textual data.
